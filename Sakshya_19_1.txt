 Project Solution
 We will include post events with title, date, description, image, registration
 link, and tags and then try to make a dedicated page for each club/organization
and its related information like contact info and more. We will also imple
ment an announcement board for time-sensitive or important updates.
 At the end, we will keep search and lters: by date, category, club, or
 keywords to help the user interact, and nally, ensure a responsive design for
 a seamless user experience.
 As an additional feature, we will try to include registration and atten
dance tracking. The interface of the project will be made using HTML, CSS,
 React, and Tailwind. For logic building, we will use JavaScript. For the
 backend, we will use Node.js or Express.js, and for the database, we will use
 Mongoose and MongoDB.
